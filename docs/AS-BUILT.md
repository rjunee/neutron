## WAVE 3 — Email Core: thread read (`email_thread`) + doc reconciliation

**What shipped.** The Email-Managed Core (`cores/free/email/`) gained the
conversation-level READ surface it was missing. The Core already shipped
read (`email_list` / `email_read` / `email_search`), summarize, triage,
draft, and send — but there was no way to read a whole Gmail *thread*. The
WAVE 3 acceptance for the Email Core ("list/search threads, read a message,
thread metadata") needed the thread unit, so this PR adds it.

- **`email_thread` MCP tool** — fetches a whole conversation by thread id
  via Gmail's `users.threads.get?format=full`. Returns every message in
  the thread plus derived thread metadata: `subject` (from the oldest
  message), `message_count`, `last_message_date`, the distinct
  `participants` (From/To/Cc union, first-seen order), the `label_ids`
  union, and the full `messages` array **oldest-first** (conversation
  reading order — the inverse of the newest-first list/search ordering).
  One round-trip for the whole thread (no N+1, unlike list/search).
  Read-capability gated (`read:email_managed_core.messages`).
- **Backend** (`src/backend.ts`) — `GmailThreadFull` / `GmailThreadGetInput`
  types, `ThreadNotFoundError`, and `getThread` on the `GmailClient`
  interface, implemented across both in-memory fakes
  (`buildInMemoryGmailClient`, `buildSeededInMemoryGmailClient`) and the
  production `buildGoogleGmailClient`. A shared pure `assembleThread`
  helper derives the metadata identically across backends.
- **Chat parity** — `/email thread <id>` chat command (agent-native parity:
  the agent's MCP tool and the user's chat command hit the same path).
- **Manifest** — `email_thread` declared in `package.json` `neutron.tools`;
  `TOOL_NAMES` updated to eight tools.
- **Defect fix** — removed the dangling `./mcp-tools-extra` entry from the
  Core's `package.json` `exports` map (the referenced file never existed).
- **Docs reconciliation** — `README.md` was several sprints stale: it
  documented a "Tier 1 no-send guarantee" and a 3-scope grant, but the
  Core had already shipped `email_send` + the `gmail.send` scope (gap-audit
  P0 reversal, 2026-06-20). Rewrote the send section + scope table to match
  the shipped reality and added `email_thread`. Added an Email Core section
  to `docs/SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md` (previously unmentioned).

**Tests.** `cores/free/email/__tests__/thread.test.ts` (11 new): backend
`getThread` on both in-memory fakes (ordering, participant/label union,
`ThreadNotFoundError`), the production wrapper against a mocked
`users.threads.get` (full-payload mapping + 404 + empty-thread →
`ThreadNotFoundError`), the `email_thread` tool (audit row), and the
`/email thread` command. Full Email Core suite: 159 pass / 0 fail. `tsc`
clean against `cores/free/email/tsconfig.json`.

**Not in scope / follow-ups.** Thread-level *listing* (a "list threads"
surface distinct from per-message `email_list`) — `email_list` already
returns `thread_id` on every row, so callers group client-side; a native
thread-list endpoint is deferred until the surface needs it. Attachment
surfacing and RFC 2047 encoded-word subjects remain follow-ups (unchanged).
