## 2026-06-29 — M1: stale-client-store auto-reset on server reinstall

**Problem.** A fresh Neutron Open server reinstall showed a STALE chat: the web
client's offline local store (`@neutron/chat-core` OPFS snapshot, origin-scoped
`neutron-chat-core.json`) — and the mobile op-sqlite store (`neutron-chat.db`) —
survive a server uninstall+reinstall behind the same origin/device. The server's
per-topic `seq` counter restarts at 1 on a fresh install, but the client resumed
forward from its OLD high local cursor (`resume after_seq=<high>`), so the
server's `replayAfter` returned nothing and the dead server's transcript
rendered forever. `session_ready.last_seen_seq` already carried the server's
high-water seq but NO client code read it.

**Fix (seq-regression reset detection, no flags).**
- `chat-core/types.ts` — new `parseSessionReadyMaxSeq(frame)`: extracts
  `last_seen_seq` from a `session_ready` frame, `null` when absent/malformed.
- `chat-core/sync-engine.ts` — new `SyncEngine.reconcileServerReset(topic, serverMaxSeq)`:
  when the server's reported seq is a known number **strictly lower** than a
  **non-zero** local cursor, the server regressed (was wiped/reinstalled) →
  `store.clear(topic)` so the following `resume` re-syncs from `after_seq=0`.
  Conservative: no-op when seq is absent (`null`), when server seq ≥ local
  cursor (normal reconnect/cold-open/first-connect), or when the local cursor
  is 0 (nothing cached).
- `chat-core/web-session.ts` + `app/lib/chat-core/mobile-session.ts` — both
  `session_ready` handlers call `reconcileServerReset(frame)` BEFORE
  `resumeAndFlush()`, and emit a UI change on a real reset so the stale messages
  drop immediately (before the replay lands). The detection lives in the SHARED
  `SyncEngine`, so web (OPFS) and mobile (op-sqlite) both benefit.
- `app/lib/ws-envelope.ts` — added `last_seen_seq?` to `AppWsOutboundSessionReady`
  for type parity with the server envelope (`channels/adapters/app-ws/envelope.ts`).

**Server change (Codex P1a).** `gateway/http/app-ws-surface.ts` now ALWAYS sends
`session_ready.last_seen_seq` when a durable log is wired, **including 0**.
Previously it omitted the field on 0, so a freshly reinstalled server whose log
was still empty at connect time (the welcome messages persist AFTER
`session_ready`) sent no signal → the stale client never reset on its first
post-reinstall load. A present `0` is now an affirmative "this server has nothing
for the topic" signal; the field stays ABSENT only when there is no durable log
at all (where `null` → never clear, protecting the only copy). `open/composer.ts`
wires the durable `AppChatStore` chat_log, so Open always reports the real value.

**No-data-loss on reset (Codex P1b + P2).** Added a `Store.clearAckedTranscript(topic)`
primitive (InMemory + OPFS + Sqlite) that drops only the ACKED (server-sequenced)
transcript in a SINGLE atomic store operation, preserving un-acked local sends
(status `queued`/`sent`, no server seq). `reconcileServerReset` calls it instead
of a read-clear-reinsert cycle, so a send that races the reset can't be lost in a
snapshot→clear window (it's either an already-kept non-acked row or arrives
after). The preserved sends are re-driven against the fresh server by the
following resume/flush (idempotent on `client_msg_id`).

**Not changed.** No new local-store namespace keyed on a server instance id (the
frame exposes no per-install id today; the seq-regression heuristic is the
pragmatic detector per the bug note).

**Tests.** `chat-core/__tests__/session-ready.test.ts` (parser edge cases),
`chat-core/__tests__/sync-engine.test.ts` (reconcile: clears on regression;
no-op on ≥, null, cursor-0, un-sequenced optimistic sends),
`chat-core/__tests__/web-session.test.ts` + `app/__tests__/chat-core-mobile-session.test.ts`
(end-to-end: stale transcript cleared + `resume after_seq=0` + fresh replay
renders clean; normal reconnect preserves; absent `last_seen_seq` never wipes).
