/**
 * @neutronai/agent-dispatch — watchdog → report-back adapter.
 *
 * The already-ported agent-aware watchdog (`runtime/subagent/watchdog.ts`)
 * reaps a stuck/dead LIVE record, marks it `crashed`, and SURFACES a structured
 * `AgentWatchdogEvent` through an injected `notify` sink. This adapter turns
 * that event into a dispatch `report` so a supervised failure reaches the SAME
 * report-back surface a clean completion does — a dispatched agent that wedges
 * or dies never just silently vanishes from `live()`.
 *
 * It only handles the three kinds THIS dispatcher owns (`atlas`/`sentinel`/
 * `core` → research/review/adhoc). A `forge`/`argus` watchdog event belongs to
 * the Trident loop and is skipped (returns without reporting), so wiring this
 * notifier alongside Trident's own supervision does not double-report a build
 * agent.
