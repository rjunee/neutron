 * deleted `llm-prompt-driver.ts`. The `promptDriver` seam was never wired
 * in production (`open/composer.ts` wires `phaseSpecResolver` + `llmRouter`
 * only) and was removed when the onboarding engine collapsed onto the
 * single `llmRouter` extraction path. The `ExtractedFields` shape and the
 * `sanitizeUserFirstName` validator, however, are consumed by the SURVIVING
 * router-best-effort extraction in `engine.ts`
 * (`extractGapFillFieldsViaRouterBestEffort`, `mergeGapFillExtractedFields`)
 * and the signup name-capture path, so they live here as a leaf module with
 * no engine/driver dependencies.
