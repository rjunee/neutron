/**
 * A credential-gated E2E must have a RUNNER, or the gate is a deletion that still
 * looks like coverage.
 *
 * ISSUES #509. Three suites are gated behind `NEUTRON_PTY_E2E=1` because they
 * spawn a real `claude` under a real PTY and need working credentials, which CI
 * does not have. The gate is correct. What was wrong is that the variable was set
 * in ZERO places — not CI, not a script, not a documented command — so none of the
 * three had ever run anywhere, while each reported `0 pass, N skip, 0 fail`, which
 * reads as a passing file in any summary that counts failures.
 *
 * That mattered concretely. One of them is the T7 acceptance for the shipped
 * ritual templates, and its existence is what someone would cite to claim that
 * criterion is covered. Run for the first time on 2026-08-07, two cases passed and
 * the third COULD NOT pass: its reply poll gave up at 60s while its own test budget
 * was 180s, so the heaviest ritual reported "produced nothing" when the truth was
 * "our wait was shorter than the work".
 *
 * This test is the thing that keeps that from recurring: it runs in CI, it does
 * NOT need credentials, and it fails if a gated suite is not registered in
 * `scripts/run-pty-e2e.sh`. It cannot prove anyone RAN the suites — nothing in CI
 * can — but it does guarantee that "how do I run this" always has an answer, and
 * that adding a new gated suite forces you to answer it.
