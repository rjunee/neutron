/**
 * @neutronai/trident — the autonomous-build state machine.
 *
 * `advanceTridentRun(run, deps)` is the pure-ish transition function the
 * tick loop calls for every non-terminal run. It is the SQLite-row port
 * of Vajra's `/trident` skill loop (SKILL.md "## Subcommand: /trident
 * check"): each phase, on its in-flight sub-agent completing, advances to
 * the next phase per the skill's transition graph.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SCOPE — PR-2 lands the SKELETON: the phase enum, the transition graph,
 * the round / ralph-round caps, and terminal handling. The two seams the
 * graph hangs off of are PR-3 and PR-4:
 *
 *   • PR-3 (Forge/Argus spawning) — owns `deps.classify`: reading the
 *     in-flight sub-agent's registry status + result log and turning it
 *     into a `SubagentOutcome` (running / crashed / completed-with-result),
 *     AND spawning the NEXT phase's sub-agent after a transition. PR-2
 *     ships `stubAdvanceDeps`, whose `classify` always reports `running`,
 *     so the loop is wired + restart-safe but never advances on its own.
 *
 *   • PR-4 (Ralph) — the `forge-init → ralph-plan → ralph-task` cycle is
 *     fully wired HERE (the transition graph + the `max_ralph_rounds`
 *     cap), but the planner / one-task Forge spawns those phases drive
 *     are PR-4's job via the same `deps.classify` seam.
 *
 * The transition graph itself (`computeTransition`) is pure + fully unit
 * tested now so PR-3/PR-4 only wire I/O, never re-derive control flow.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SHIPPED-ARCHITECTURE NOTE (Trident v2 exec-model): production no longer
 * drives this per-phase graph for the inner loop. The live Forge→Argus→fix
 * loop is one native CC Dynamic Workflow (`inner-workflow.mjs`), and the
 * Ralph plan→task→repeat cycle (`ralph-plan`/`ralph-task` below) is driven
 * by the OUTER `orchestrator.ts` via the `remaining_tasks` re-fire
 * (`refireNextRalphTask`, #362) — NOT by `computeTransition`. This module is
 * RETAINED for: the `stubAdvanceDeps` restart-safe no-op fallback (wired when
 * the exec-model orchestrator is absent), one-commit revertibility, and its
 * role as the executable cross-repo parity anchor for Vajra's `/trident` skill
 * loop (`vajra-fixes.test.ts`). Its `ralph-plan`/`ralph-task`/`forge-fix`
 * branches are therefore not reached in the shipped exec-model path.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
