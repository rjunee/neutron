/**
 * @neutronai/trident — the orchestration step (Trident v2 · Work Board Phase 2a
 * EXEC-MODEL rearchitecture).
 *
 * The durable OUTER loop (`tick.ts` + the `code_trident_runs` SQLite table)
 * calls `step(run)` for every non-terminal run. As of Phase 2a the INNER
 * Forge→Argus→fix loop is ONE native CC Dynamic Workflow
 * (`trident/inner-workflow.mjs`), FIRED per run via a `TridentWorkflowFirer`
 * (`trident/inner-loop.ts`) on a WARM substrate whose launching turn settles
 * immediately. The workflow then runs DETACHED in the background and persists
 * its TYPED terminal result to the run row (`inner_result`); this step HARVESTS
 * that result from the DB by `runId` — deterministic TS, never an LLM-parsed
 * stdout line, never an in-memory build-result map.
 *
 * What this step owns (the OUTER concerns):
 *
 *   1. LAUNCH-IF-NEEDED. A live run with no in-flight dispatch
 *      (`subagent_run_id === null`) gets the workflow FIRED now: mint a tracking
 *      uuid, FIRE the workflow (the launching turn settles in seconds), and on a
 *      clean fire persist the id + `subagent_status='running'`. Idempotent
 *      crash-resume: before firing, fold any existing PR/branch + the last
 *      `inner_checkpoint` into the args so the workflow REUSES the PR (no
 *      duplicate) and skips finished phases.
 *
 *   2. HARVEST. With a workflow in flight, read the run's `inner_result` each
 *      tick. Once the workflow has written its TYPED terminal result, decode it
 *      (`parseInnerResult`), SERVER-GATE a merge-eligible `APPROVE` against the
 *      Argus-phase-recorded `inner_checkpoint='argus-approved'` (never a
 *      self-asserted result line), then on APPROVE → phase `done`
 *      (persist pr/branch/inner_verdict) + merge (`cleanupAfterMerge`, the
 *      outer/human gate); on REQUEST_CHANGES / failed-provenance → phase `failed`
 *      with a named reason (recoverable: re-run), never a silent success.
 *
 *   3. CRASH RECOVERY. The durable row is authoritative; harvest works across a
 *      process restart because the result lives in the DB, not in memory. A
 *      persisted `subagent_run_id` this process did NOT fire (lost on restart)
 *      AND no `inner_result` yet is an ORPHAN — re-fired per
 *      `on_orphaned_session` (a redispatch resumes from `inner_checkpoint`,
 *      bounded to one per process; a workflow that already merged is terminal so
 *      never re-fired → no double-merge). A workflow that fired but goes silent
 *      past `max_inflight_ms` with no checkpoint is reaped as a stalled run.
 *
 * `state-machine.ts` (`computeTransition`/`advanceTridentRun`) is intentionally
 * KEPT intact (its unit tests + one-commit revertibility) even though this prod
 * step no longer drives the per-phase graph for the inner loop.
