/**
 * @neutronai/trident — the orchestration step (Trident v2 · Work Board Phase 2a
 * EXEC-MODEL rearchitecture).
 *
 * The durable OUTER loop (`tick.ts` + the `code_trident_runs` SQLite table)
 * calls `step(run)` for every non-terminal run. As of Phase 2a the INNER
 * Forge→Argus→fix loop is ONE native CC Dynamic Workflow
 * (`trident/inner-workflow.mjs`), FIRED per run via a `TridentWorkflowFirer`
 * (`trident/inner-loop.ts`) on a WARM substrate whose launching turn settles
 * immediately. The workflow then runs DETACHED in the background and persists
 * its TYPED terminal result to the run row (`inner_result`); this step HARVESTS
 * that result from the DB by `runId` — deterministic TS, never an LLM-parsed
 * stdout line, never an in-memory build-result map.
 *
 * What this step owns (the OUTER concerns):
 *
 *   1. LAUNCH-IF-NEEDED. A live run with no in-flight dispatch
 *      (`subagent_run_id === null`) gets the workflow FIRED now: mint a tracking
 *      uuid, FIRE the workflow (the launching turn settles in seconds), and on a
 *      clean fire persist the id + `subagent_status='running'`. Idempotent
 *      crash-resume: before firing, fold any existing PR/branch + the last
 *      `inner_checkpoint` into the args so the workflow REUSES the PR (no
 *      duplicate) and skips finished phases.
 *
 *   2. HARVEST. With a workflow in flight, read the run's `inner_result` each
 *      tick. Once the workflow has written its TYPED terminal result, decode it
 *      (`parseInnerResult`), SERVER-GATE a merge-eligible `APPROVE` against the
 *      Argus-phase-recorded `inner_checkpoint='argus-approved'` (never a
 *      self-asserted result line), then on APPROVE → phase `done`
 *      (persist pr/branch/inner_verdict) + merge (`cleanupAfterMerge`, the
 *      outer/human gate); on REQUEST_CHANGES / failed-provenance → phase `failed`
 *      with a named reason (recoverable: re-run), never a silent success.
 *
 *      RALPH RE-FIRE (#362): a harvested result carrying `remaining_tasks > 0` is
 *      an INTERMEDIATE Ralph iteration — one task built, more remain. Instead of
 *      merging (the bug: multi-task builds shipped after task 1), `applyResult`
 *      RE-FIRES a fresh inner iteration for the next task (`refireNextRalphTask`:
 *      reset the sub-agent slot, keep branch/PR + the 'ralph-task-built' resume
 *      checkpoint, bump `ralph_round`, cap at `max_ralph_rounds`). This — not
 *      `state-machine.ts` — is where the live plan→task→repeat loop is driven in
 *      the exec model.
 *
 *   3. CRASH RECOVERY. The durable row is authoritative; harvest works across a
 *      process restart because the result lives in the DB, not in memory. A
 *      persisted `subagent_run_id` this process did NOT fire (lost on restart)
 *      AND no `inner_result` yet is an ORPHAN — re-fired per
 *      `on_orphaned_session` (a redispatch resumes from `inner_checkpoint`,
 *      bounded to one per process; a workflow that already merged is terminal so
 *      never re-fired → no double-merge). A workflow that fired but goes silent
 *      past `max_inflight_ms` with no checkpoint is reaped as a stalled run.
 *
 * `state-machine.ts` (`computeTransition`/`advanceTridentRun`) is intentionally
 * KEPT intact — for its `stubAdvanceDeps` restart-safe no-op fallback (used when
 * trident isn't wired to the exec-model orchestrator), its unit tests, its
 * one-commit revertibility, AND its role as the executable cross-repo PARITY
 * anchor for the legacy harness's `/trident` skill loop (`legacy-fixes.test.ts`). The exec-model
 * step above no longer drives its per-phase graph for the inner loop; in
 * particular the Ralph plan→task→repeat cycle is now driven HERE via the
 * `remaining_tasks` re-fire (`refireNextRalphTask`, #362), NOT by
 * `computeTransition`'s `ralph-plan`/`ralph-task` branches.

 * APPROVE` — interpolating the CONFIGURED CEILING, which is not a measurement of anything.
 * On 2026-08-13 four runs with four different causes (ten real review rounds; `CODEX_HOME`

 * 10 round(s)". Three of them ended at ROUND 1 having never run a reviewer. Each time the
 * sentence read as a diagnosis, so the next person looked at review quality instead of the
 * build — it cost the owner an hour, then another.
 *
 * THE RULE (owner, 2026-08-13, verbatim): *"If it's a generic catchall make the error
 * message generic."* Generalised: A MESSAGE MUST NOT ASSERT A CAUSE IT DID NOT MEASURE.
 * Only ONE shape may claim exhaustion — the rounds actually ran out. Everything else says
 * what IS known (the round reached, the ceiling, the last checkpoint) and claims nothing
 * more. Generic-and-true beats specific-and-wrong; a confidently-worded default is the
 * failure mode, because it stops the reader looking further.
 *
 * `result.round` and `result.checkpoint` were ALWAYS in scope at the call site. Nothing
 * needed to be plumbed; they simply were not read.

 * Exported because the defect was invisible while this was an inline template literal —
 * there was nothing a test could hold. Keep it reachable.
