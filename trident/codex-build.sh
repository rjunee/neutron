# trident BUILD-ON-CODEX wrapper — runs the Forge build as a `codex exec`
# subprocess instead of as a Claude `agent()`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The build is by far the most expensive phase of a trident run,
# and until now it could only be dispatched through the workflow's own
# `agent({model})`, which resolves against Claude Code's endpoint. So every build
# spent Anthropic quota no matter what the settings pane said. A codex substrate
# adapter has existed and been registered for a while (`runtime/adapters/codex-cli/`,
# selected in `runtime/adapters/select-substrate.ts`) and trident's own review seat
# already shells into `codex exec` (`trident/codex-review.sh`) — what was missing was
# a route from the BUILD step to it. This is that route: the same shape as the review
# wrapper, one phase further up.
#
# WHAT IT IS HANDED, and what it hands back:
#
#   in  NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_BRIEF_FILE  the assembled Forge brief (contract + task).
#                                       Composed by `trident/inner-workflow.mjs` — the
#                                       SAME text the Claude builder gets, plus a coda
#                                       about how to report — so the two builders
#                                       cannot drift into building different things.
#   in  NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_DIFF_FILE   where the brief told the build to write the
#                                       branch diff, so this script can report whether
#                                       it actually appeared.
#   in  NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_TRAILER_FILE where to WRITE the measured trailer. Required
#                                       — see below for why it is not stdout.
#   in  CODEX_HOME                      the per-project subscription credential dir.
#   in  CODEX_BUILD_MODEL               which GPT tier to build on. A DIFFERENT knob
#                                       from the reviewer's `CODEX_REVIEW_MODEL` on
#                                       purpose: on a box that exports both, one name
#                                       would silently point the reviewer at the
#                                       build's model (or the reverse).
#   arg $1                              the branch the build is expected to land on.
#
#   out  the codex transcript on stdout; the MEASURED trailer in the trailer file.
#
# ── THE TRAILER IS THE POINT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The inner loop needs four facts from a build — branch, commit sha, PR number,
# diff file — and downstream those facts are load-bearing: `reviewedHead` pins the
# merge to the reviewed commit (`gh pr merge --match-head-commit`, #545) and
# `roundLanded` refuses to re-review a round that left no trace on the branch.
#
# A Claude Forge agent REPORTS those through a schema; it is reporting on itself.
# `codex exec` can be handed `--output-schema` (this CLI has the flag) — but a
# schema-shaped answer is still the MODEL's claim about its own work, and the failing
# case is exactly the one where the model believes it committed. A schema constrains
# the SHAPE of a wrong answer, not its truth. So this script does not ask. After codex
# exits it MEASURES the facts with git and gh and writes them itself:
#
#   NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_BRANCH=      `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
#   NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_HEAD=        the commit THIS RUN produced (see below)
#   NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_REMOTE_HEAD= that same commit, confirmed pushed, or empty
#   NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_PR=          `gh pr list --head` — the PR number, or empty
#   NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_DIFF=        the diff file path, or empty if it is missing
#                                    or empty
#   NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_WORKTREE=    `pwd`
#
# Every one of them is EMPTY rather than wrong when it cannot be established, and
# the bridge that reads them passes the empty value straight through. An empty sha
# fails closed at both gates: no review of an unbuilt branch, and no merge.
#
# ── THE TWO SHAS ARE BOTH ABOUT *THIS* BUILD, NEVER ABOUT THE BRANCH ─────────
# `HEAD` is recorded only when the local head is not where it was when codex STARTED.
# A build that edited files and never committed leaves HEAD on the base commit, and
# reporting that would hand the round a sha whose tree contains none of its work —
# `roundLanded` would see a "landed" round and the merge would pin to a commit the
# build did not make. Unmoved head → empty, which is the invariant above.
#
# `REMOTE_HEAD` is that measured local sha CONFIRMED PUSHED — it is emitted only when
# the remote branch tip EQUALS it, and is otherwise empty. It is deliberately not "the
# current tip of the remote branch": that is a fresh probe of a shared ref, and
# `trident/inner-workflow.mjs` forbids exactly that for `reviewedHead` (a commit pushed
# by anything else between the build and the probe would be read back and then pinned
# by `--match-head-commit`, certifying as reviewed a commit no reviewer saw). Equality
# turns the remote into a WITNESS for our own sha instead of a source for someone
# else's, and every disagreement — stale branch, concurrent push, failed push — comes
# out empty and fails closed.
#
# ── WHY THE TRAILER IS A FILE AND NOT THE TAIL OF STDOUT ─────────────────────
# stdout also carries the codex transcript, which is model-controlled text. A build
# that quotes this header, or narrates "I printed NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_HEAD=<sha>",
# puts a second trailer-shaped block in front of the reader with no way to tell which
# one was measured. The bridge reads THIS FILE and nothing else, and the file is
# written (truncating) after codex exits, so anything the model wrote there is gone.
#
# ── THE SANDBOX GRANT, AND WHY IT IS THIS WIDE ───────────────────────────────
# `--sandbox danger-full-access`. Deliberate, and the narrower policies were checked
# against what a build actually does rather than assumed:
#
#   • `read-only` (the exec default) cannot edit a file.
#   • `workspace-write` writes only inside the workspace, and a trident build writes
#     outside it twice over: it runs in a git WORKTREE, whose `.git` is a file pointing
#     at `<repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>` (so the first `git commit` writes out of tree),
#     and it writes its branch diff to a path under /tmp. `--add-dir` — a real flag on
#     this CLI — can widen the write set to cover both.
#   • What `--add-dir` cannot grant is NETWORK, which `workspace-write` denies. Steps 3
#     and 4 of the Forge contract are `git push` and `gh pr create`, and a build that
#     installs a dependency needs it too.
#
# So the narrow policy would have to be re-widened along both axes, one flag at a time,
# to arrive at the same reach with more moving parts and more ways to be subtly wrong.
#
# A build that cannot commit, push or open a PR is not a build; it produces no sha
# and the run stops at the trailer above. The blast radius is bounded by the same
# thing that bounds the Claude builder, which runs with the same powers: an isolated
# git worktree on its own branch, a review panel that reads the diff, and a merge
# pinned to the reviewed commit. This grant makes the codex builder EQUAL to the
# Claude builder, not more privileged than it.
#
# Usage (from inside the build worktree):
#   CODEX_HOME=<dir> NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_BRIEF_FILE=<file> \
#     NEUTRON_CODEX_BUILD_TRAILER_FILE=<file> bash trident/codex-build.sh <branch>
#
# Exit codes mirror `trident/codex-review.sh`, and the bridge maps them the same way:
#   0   BUILT         — codex ran to completion. Read the trailer.
#   10  NOT_CONNECTED — no CODEX_HOME / no auth.json.
#   11  NOT_CONNECTED — codex CLI not on PATH.
#   3   DEFERRED      — configured but the build could not be STARTED (auth precheck
#                       failed, or no brief was handed in).
#   5   DEFERRED      — codex ran and exited non-zero.
# Unlike the REVIEW lane, NOT_CONNECTED is not a graceful degrade here: a build that
# did not happen is not a reduced panel, it is no build. The bridge reports it and
# the workflow stops rather than quietly re-running on Claude — the owner moved the
# build off Anthropic on purpose, and a silent fallback would spend the quota they
# were trying to protect and hide that it had done so.
