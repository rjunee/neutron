/**
 * @neutronai/runtime — subagent lifecycle tick.
 *
 * Runs on a periodic tick (default 60s), driven by the gateway's main interval.
 * One ordered tick with two phases:
 *
 *   1. **Liveness surfacing** (when `watchdog` deps are supplied): runs the
 *      agent-aware watchdog (`watchdog.ts`) — detects stale/dead `running`
 *      records, marks them failed, and NOTIFIES — then …
 *   2. **Cleanup-after pruning**: deletes terminal records
 *      (`finished`|`crashed`|`cancelled`) past their `cleanup_after`.
 *
 * The watchdog runs BEFORE the prune so the single tick both surfaces a failing
 * agent and reaps already-terminal ones, in a defined order, with no second
 * independent reaper to race. Liveness reaping USED to live in this file as a
 * SILENT pass (it `cancelRun`'d stale records / marked pid-gone ones `crashed`
 * with no notification); that logic moved into the watchdog so failures are
 * surfaced, and this tick now COMPOSES the watchdog rather than duplicating it.
 *
 * Omit the `watchdog` deps to run a prune-only tick (e.g. a cleanup-only
 * scheduler); the watchdog can also be driven standalone via `runAgentWatchdog`.
