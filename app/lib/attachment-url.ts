 * successful echo swaps them for the `/api/app/upload/<user>/<hash>.<ext>`
 * server URL via `reconcileEcho`. A FAILED send never echoed, so on
 * `retry()` the bubble still holds local URIs — and the gateway's

 * `https?://`- or `/`-prefixed (`channels/adapters/app-ws/envelope.ts`),
 * so the image-only retry 400s (`missing_body`) and a text+image retry
 * silently loses the image.
 *
 * Routing every stored URI back through `uploadFn` (which itself no-ops
 * any entry that is already an uploaded URL, via
 * `isAlreadyUploadedAttachmentUrl`) guarantees the gateway only ever sees
 * URLs it will accept — and makes retry idempotent for the
 * already-uploaded case + recoverable for the upload-failed case.
