/**
 * @neutronai/open — the `late<T>` two-phase holder seam (C3d).
 *
 * The Open composer has several "late-bound holders": a value CREATED early in
 * the `createOpenComposition` closure, MUTATED (bound) much later once its real
 * dependency exists, and READ — often fire-and-forget via optional-chain
 * (`holder.x?.method(...)`) — from runtime paths scattered across the closure.
 * The classic shape was a bare mutable object:
 *
 *     const holder: { adapter?: AppWsAdapter } = {}
 *     // ...much later...
 *     holder.adapter = new AppWsAdapter(...)
 *     // ...runtime fire-and-forget...
 *     void holder.adapter?.send(msg)   // silently no-ops if unbound
 *
 * `late<T>(name)` replaces that ad-hoc pattern with an explicit two-phase seam
 * that PRESERVES the exact production behaviour (a deref before `bind` is still a
 * no-op) while adding two things the bare object lacked:
 *
 *   1. OBSERVABILITY — a deref-before-bind logs loudly and increments a
 *      per-seam counter (there is no `system_events` table in this repo, so the
 *      counter is an in-process Map exposed for tests + an injectable sink; the
 *      default sink also emits the repo-standard `[open] event=…` warn line).
 *   2. TEST-STRICTNESS — under `NODE_ENV === 'test'` a deref-before-bind THROWS,
 *      so a unit test catches an ordering bug the silent `?.` would have hidden.
 *
 * CRITICAL — deref-before-bind semantics (the Verifier amendment):
 *   - AFTER `bind(value)`, `deref(fn)` returns `fn(value)` — callers use it
 *     exactly as the old `holder.x?.foo(...)` did.
 *   - BEFORE `bind`, `deref(fn)` must NOT throw in production (these holders sit
 *     in fire-and-forget runtime paths — e.g. `onboardingMsg.deref(emit => …)`
 *     fired from the import-completion watcher; a throw would be a behaviour
 *     change). It logs loudly, bumps the counter, and returns `undefined`
 *     (skipping `fn`) — byte-identical to the old silent `?.` no-op.
 *   - The throw escalation is gated on `NODE_ENV === 'test'` ONLY, so prod stays
 *     a no-op and tests stay strict.
 *
 * `isBound()` / `get()` are plain accessors (no logging, no throw) for the call
 * sites that are presence-checks (`holder.x !== undefined`) or a post-bind direct
 * read — NOT `?.` derefs. Only the `?.` fire-paths map onto `deref`.
 *
 * This is a NEW leaf the composer imports DOWNWARD — it never imports back into
 * `open/composer.ts`.
