/**
 * @neutronai/open — scribe / GBrain / reflection wiring (C3a, carve #2).
 *
 * Behavior-preserving extraction of the memory slice of
 * `createOpenComposition` (old `open/composer.ts` lines 845-987): the dedicated
 * `cc-scribe-*` extraction substrate, the lazy fail-soft GBrain memory + its
 * `syncHook`, the `cc-reflection-*` correction-judge substrate + `reflection`,
 * the `scribeOnUserTurn` chat-bridge hook, and the Cores→scribe phase-2 fan-out.
 *
 * This slice is SELF-CONTAINED given the wiring context — it builds its own
 * `cc-scribe-*` / `cc-reflection-*` substrates directly and consumes NOTHING
 * that `wireSubstrates` produces, so it takes only `ctx`.
 *
 * Teardown hooks that were pushed inline onto the composer's `realmodeCleanups`
 * (the GBrain `close()` and the Cores fan-out `stop()`) are collected into the
 * returned `cleanups` array IN THE SAME ORDER; the composer appends them onto
 * `realmodeCleanups` at the carve site so SIGTERM ordering is byte-identical.

  // extract→GBrain path AND the chat-bridge fires `scribeOnUserTurn` after
  // every real user turn — but the param is OPTIONAL and the Open self-host
  // composer never threaded it, so chat-time extraction was DEAD in Open:
  // every person/company mention stayed a manual wiki entry. This wires it ON.
  //
  // A DEDICATED `cc-scribe-*` substrate (not the conversational `cc-agent-*`
  // one) keeps background extraction isolated from the live chat REPL — scribe
  // is a stateless one-shot caller (build-llm-call-substrate.ts names it
  // explicitly), so `ephemeral: true` gives per-extraction isolation on the
  // persistent substrate rather than accumulating extraction prompts into a
  // chat transcript. Gated on `llmPool` exactly like every other substrate:
  // LLM-less boxes have no extractor, so scribe stays off and the chat path is
  // unaffected (`scribeOnUserTurn` omitted → bridge no-ops).

  // GBrain memory wiring is the scribe write target. `buildGBrainMemory` is
  // LAZY + FAIL-SOFT by contract: it emits ONE loud boot warning when the
  // `gbrain` binary is absent from PATH, then every memory op degrades to a
  // single latched failure (the entity page still lands on disk; only the
  // GBrain fan-out no-ops). So a missing/unresolvable GBrain NEVER crashes a
  // chat turn — it degrades with a clear log, exactly as the spec requires.
  // Built only when scribe can run (there is no point standing up a write
  // target with no extractor to feed it).
  // GBrain wiring is hoisted out of the scribe closure so the SAME syncHook
  // feeds three consumers: the chat-time scribe (below), the onboarding
  // materializer's project-page indexer (threaded into `buildLandingStack` as
  // `importGbrainSyncHook` so imported/onboarding projects land in MEMORY/
  // gbrain — previously unwired in Open), and the Path 1 onboarding finalize.
  // Lazy + fail-soft: building it never spawns `gbrain serve` until first use.
  //
  // ND1: activate GBrain semantic embeddings from the owner's onboarding-
  // captured OpenAI key (ApiKeyStore, provider=openai label=onboarding;
  // internal_handle == project_slug). When present, GBrain serves with
  // OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`; absent → keyword + graph default.
  //
  // LAZY resolution (not an eager read here): this composition runs ONCE at
  // process boot, but the key is captured LATER — during onboarding / via the
  // admin Integrations surface, over the already-running server. An eager read
  // at boot would miss every freshly-pasted key until a restart (the bug:
  // "Openai embeddings key is supposed to be wired to Gbrain"). Threading a
  // resolver thunk instead defers the read to the FIRST `gbrain serve` spawn
  // (first memory op, after onboarding), so the key flips on embeddings at the
  // next turn — exactly what the onboarding offer promises. Best-effort: the
  // resolver swallows store errors and returns undefined (keyword + graph).
